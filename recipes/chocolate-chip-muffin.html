    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk: This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk</li>
        <li>Oil: Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the batter structure</li>
        <li>Sugars: You'll need white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the muffins, but it won't make them taste salty</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
